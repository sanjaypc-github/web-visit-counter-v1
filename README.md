## Deploy backend to Render

This repo includes a Render Blueprint (`render.yaml`) to deploy the backend.

Steps:

1. Create a MongoDB database (e.g., MongoDB Atlas) and copy its connection string.
2. Push your latest changes to GitHub.
3. In Render, create a new Blueprint and select this repository. Render will detect `render.yaml`.
4. Set environment variables for the service:
   - `MONGODB_URI`: your MongoDB connection string
   - `NODE_ENV`: `production`
5. Render will build (`npm install`) and start (`node server.js`) the backend under `backend/`.
6. After itâ€™s live, note the service URL (e.g., `https://<service>.onrender.com`).

Frontend configuration:

1. In the project root, create a `.env` file with:
```
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://<service>.onrender.com
```
2. Rebuild and deploy the frontend:
```
npm run build
npm run deploy
```
Your GitHub Pages site will now call the deployed backend.
